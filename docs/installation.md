At the moments salmonjs is available only a NPM package.

So, you can install it directly from NPM using the following command:

```
[user@hostname ~]$ npm install salmonjs -g
```

Eventually you can get the source code from GitHub and then run this command:

```
[user@hostname ~/salmonjs]$ npm install
```
